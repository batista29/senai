        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and stylish platform that elevates</p>
        <p>your screen to a more comfortable viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye level has</p>
        <p>the potential to improve your posture and make you more comfortable while at work,</p>
        <p>helping you stay focused on the task at hand.</p>

        <p> Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra desk space below</p>
        <p>your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under the stand.</p>
